        Love will abide
        Take things in stride
        Sounds like good advice
        But there's no one at my side
        And time washes clean love's wounds unseen
        That's what someone told me
        But I don't know what it means
        'Cause I've done everything I know
        To try and make you mine
        And I think I'm gonna love you
        For a long long time
        Caught in my fears
        Blinking back the tears
        I can't say you hurt me
        When you never let me near
        And I never drew one response from you
        All the while you fell all over girls you never knew
        'Cause I've done everything I know
        To try and make you mine
        And I think it's gonna hurt me
        For a long long time
        Wait for the day you'll go away
        Knowing that you warned me
        Of the price I'd have to pay
        And life's full of flaws
        Who knows the cause?

But I don't know what it means
'Cause I've done everything I know
To try and make you mine
And I think I'm gonna love you
For a long long time
Caught in my fears
Blinking back the tears
I can't say you hurt me
When you never let me near
And I never drew one response from you
All the while you fell all over girls you never knew
'Cause I've done everything I know
To try and make you mine
And I think it's gonna hurt me
For a long long time
Wait for the day you'll go away
Knowing that you warned me
Of the price I'd have to pay
And life's full of flaws
Who knows the cause?
Living in the memory of a love that never was
'Cause I've done everything I know
To try and change your mind
And I think I'm gonna miss you
For a long long time
'Cause I've done everything I know
To try and make you mine
And I think I'm gonna love you
For a long long time
Love will abide
Take things in stride
Sounds like good advice
But there's no one at my side
And time washes clean love's wounds unseen
That's what someone told me
But I don't know what it means
